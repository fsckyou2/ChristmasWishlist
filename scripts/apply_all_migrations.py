Apply all database migrations in order.

This script runs all migration scripts in sequential order, handling errors gracefully.
Each migration is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely).

Usage:
    python scripts/apply_all_migrations.py

Or in Docker:
    docker exec christmas-wishlist python scripts/apply_all_migrations.py
