pip install pip-audit

# Run security audit
pip-audit
```

As of the creation date, all dependencies are free from known critical and high severity vulnerabilities.

## Application Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Secure password hashing using Werkzeug's pbkdf2:sha256
- ✅ Session-based authentication with Flask-Login
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms via Flask-WTF
- ✅ Token-based password reset with expiration
- ✅ Token-based magic link login with expiration
- ✅ Admin-only route protection with decorators
- ✅ User impersonation tracking and session management

### Data Protection
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ XSS protection via Jinja2 automatic escaping
- ✅ Secure session cookies
- ✅ Input validation on all forms
- ✅ Email enumeration prevention (generic error messages)

### Email Security
- ✅ TLS encryption for SMTP connections
- ✅ Timed token expiration for password reset
- ✅ Timed token expiration for magic links
- ✅ Secure token generation using itsdangerous

### Privacy
- ✅ Purchase privacy: Users cannot see WHO purchased items
- ✅ Password hashing: Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- ✅ Secure token transmission via HTTPS (when configured)

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Change Default Secrets**
   - Generate a new SECRET_KEY
   - Change default ADMIN_PASSWORD
   - Never commit secrets to version control

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Obtain SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)
   - Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with HTTPS
   - Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

3. **Secure Database**
   - Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for production
   - Enable database encryption at rest
   - Regular automated backups
   - Restrict database access

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit .env file
   - Use environment-specific .env files
   - Restrict file permissions: `chmod 600 .env`

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Consider adding Flask-Limiter for rate limiting
   - Protect login, registration, and password reset endpoints
   - Prevent brute force attacks

6. **Content Security**
   - Consider adding Flask-Talisman for security headers
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Set secure cookie flags

7. **Monitoring**
   - Log authentication attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up error alerting
   - Regular security audits

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - All form inputs validated server-side
   - WTForms validators on every field
   - URL validation before scraping
   - Integer bounds checking on quantities

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Jinja2 automatic HTML escaping
   - Manual escaping where needed
   - Sanitization of user-generated content

3. **Database Security**
   - Parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy
   - No raw SQL queries
   - Proper foreign key constraints
   - Cascade deletes configured

## Known Limitations

1. **Web Scraping**
   - URL scraping may fail if sites change structure
   - No protection against malicious websites
   - Recommendation: Only scrape trusted domains (Amazon, eBay, etc.)

2. **Email Delivery**
   - Relies on third-party SMTP provider
   - Email delivery not guaranteed
   - Recommendation: Use reputable provider (Mailgun, SendGrid)

3. **SQLite**
   - Not recommended for high-concurrency production use
   - Limited scalability
   - Recommendation: Use PostgreSQL for production

4. **Session Storage**
   - Sessions stored in cookies (Flask default)
   - Limited session data capacity
   - Recommendation: Consider Redis for production

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email details to: [security contact - to be added]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours.

## Security Updates

### How to Update Dependencies

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Update specific package
pip install --upgrade package-name

# Update all packages (use with caution)
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Run security audit after updates
pip-audit
```

### Recommended Update Schedule

- **Security patches**: Immediately
- **Minor updates**: Monthly
- **Major updates**: Quarterly (with testing)

## Compliance

This application:
- ✅ Stores passwords securely (hashed)
- ✅ Uses encryption for email transmission (TLS)
- ✅ Provides data privacy (purchase anonymity)
- ⚠️ Does NOT implement:
  - GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion requests)
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  - Account recovery mechanisms beyond email
  - Audit logging for compliance

## Additional Security Measures for Production

Consider implementing:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Use Flask-Security or pyotp
   - Require for admin accounts

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask-Limiter
   ```
   - Limit login attempts
   - Limit API calls

3. **Security Headers**
   ```bash
   pip install flask-talisman
   ```
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options

4. **Account Security**
   - Password strength requirements
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Session timeout

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all admin actions
   - Log authentication events
   - Retain logs for compliance

6. **Backup Strategy**
   - Automated daily backups
   - Encrypted backup storage
   - Regular restore testing
